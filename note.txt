-- Client Reference --
 Weechat ? Vu beaucoup de gens sur slack le recommand.

-- Server --
- Servers SHOULD pick a name which contains a dot character (".", 0x2E). This can help clients disambiguate
 between server names and nicknames in a message source.

----
-- Clients --
- A client is anything connecting to a server that is not another server
- Each client is distinguished from other clients by a unique nickname (Case sensitive ? Dan | dan)

- Nicknames are non-empty strings with the following restrictions:
* They MUST NOT contain any of the following characters: space (' ', 0x20), comma (',', 0x2C), asterisk ('*', 0x2A), question mark ('?', 0x3F), exclamation mark ('!', 0x21), at sign ('@', 0x40).
* They MUST NOT start with any of the following characters: dollar ('$', 0x24), colon (':', 0x3A).
* They MUST NOT start with a character listed as a channel type prefix.
* They SHOULD NOT contain any dot character ('.', 0x2E).
Servers MAY have additional implementation-specific nickname restrictions.

----
-- Operators --
- To allow a reasonable amount of order to be kept within the IRC network, a special class of clients (operators) are allowed to perform general maintenance functions on the network. (en gros operator == admin)

----
-- Channels --
- Channel names are strings (beginning with specified prefix characters).
 Apart from the requirement of the first character being a valid channel type prefix character;
 the only restriction on a channel name is that it may not contain any spaces (' ', 0x20),
 a control G / BELL ('^G', 0x07), or a comma (',', 0x2C) (which is used as a list item separator by the protocol).

 - Type channel -
  Notre serveur n'a pas besoin de se connecter à d'autres serveurs donc seulement besoin de local channel (prefix: #)

- Channel Modes -

- Create/Join Channel -
To create a new channel or become part of an existing channel, a user is required to join
 the channel using the JOIN command. If the channel doesn’t exist prior to joining,
 the channel is created and the creating user becomes a channel operator. If the channel
 already exists, whether or not the client successfully joins that channel depends on
 the modes currently set on the channel. For example, if the channel is set to invite-only
 mode (+i), the client only joins the channel if they have been invited by another user or
 they have been exempted from requiring an invite by the channel operators.

- Channel Number a single user can join -
 A user may be joined to several channels at once, but a limit may be imposed by
 the server as to how many channels a client can be in at one time. This limit
 is specified by the CHANLIMIT RPL_ISUPPORT parameter. See the Feature Advertisement
 section for more details on RPL_ISUPPORT.

- Moderation role & permission -
 IRC servers may also define other levels of channel moderation. These can include ‘halfop’ (half operator),
 ‘protected’ (protected user/operator), ‘founder’ (channel founder), and any other positions the server
 wishes to define. These moderation levels have varying privileges and can execute, and not execute,
 various channel management commands based on what the server defines.

 The commands which may only be used by channel moderators include:

 KICK: Eject a client from the channel
 MODE: Change the channel’s modes
 INVITE: Invite a client to an invite-only channel (mode +i)
 TOPIC: Change the channel topic in a mode +t channel

- Communication Type -
 3 type de communication quand message envoyé à un channel. voir https://modern.ircdocs.horse/#communication-types
----

-- Message Format --
 An IRC message is a single line, delimited by a pair of CR ('\r', 0x0D) and LF ('\n', 0x0A) characters.
 1- When reading messages from a stream, read the incoming data into a buffer.
 Only parse and process a message once you encounter the \r\n at the end of it. If you encounter an empty message, silently ignore it.
 2- When sending messages, ensure that a pair of \r\n characters follows every single message
 your software sends out.

-- Connection setup --
 IRC client-server connections work over TCP/IP.
 The standard ports for client-server connections are TCP/6667 for plaintext,
 and TCP/6697 for TLS connections.
